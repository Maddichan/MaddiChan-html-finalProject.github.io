      <summary>My childhood and life story</summary>
      <p>
        I am a California girl. Born and bred locally. The sunsets here are beautiful and even better when spent with loved ones.
        I am married and a fulltime mom to a preteen who runs the world. Family life is amazing to say the least, and I am always learning more.
        My passion is altruism. I am always looking for my next challenge to assist with. I love working with animals and computers.
        I have developed a passion in technology over the last year. Being able to create websites and programs for all to access is really exciting to me.
        I have spent time studying SQL,Python, and C++. Getting to know Html,CSS and Javascript is amazing. Its much easier to learn in comparison ha ha.
        Thank you so much for taking out the time to read this. I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.<br>
